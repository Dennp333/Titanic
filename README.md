# Titanic
Code for a machine learning model to submit predictions to the Titanic Kaggle competition.
Feature engineering was conducted to scale numerical data with StandardScaler, encode categorical data, and reduce dimensionality by dropping highly correlated features.
Various algorithms were employed such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forrest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. Gradient Boosting acheived the best performance.
Finally, model parameters were fine-tuned using GridSearchCV.
